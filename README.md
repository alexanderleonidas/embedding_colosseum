# Embedding Strategies for High-Dimensional Imaging in Quantum Machine Learning Pipelines

To start, download [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and execute `uv sync` in your terminal.

To add packages to the project: `uv add PACKAGE_NAME`
To remove packages to the project: `uv remove PACKAGE_NAME`

Those commands will install the the packages in your local environment and add them to the project config or remove them respectively.

## Embedding Strategies
We plan to use the following four embedding strategies in our project:
- FRQI: [Flexible Representation of Quantum Images](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11128-010-0177-y) (2011)
- NEQR: [Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11128-013-0567-z) (2013)
- OQIM: [Order-encoded Quantum Image Model](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11128-019-2463-7) (2019)
- NAQSS: [Normal Arbitrary Quantum Superposition State](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11128-013-0705-7) (2014)
